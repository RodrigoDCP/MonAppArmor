# MonAppArmor

AppArmor Interactive Tool is a cybersecurity tool for Linux that improves interactivity with AppArmor, allowing system administrators to manage security profiles more efficiently and easily.

This tool features a console user interface that simplifies the process of listing, creating, managing, deactivating, and deleting AppArmor profiles. Additionally, validations have been implemented to ensure that profile files exist before performing operations on them, reducing the likelihood of user errors and increasing system security.

AppArmor Interactive Tool is designed to enhance the management of AppArmor profiles in Linux systems and help system administrators maintain more effective control over their infrastructure's security.

In summary, this tool is useful for Linux system administrators who want to create AppArmor profiles in a simple and visual way, making it accessible to users with different levels of command-line skills.

# Status

The program is now completed and functional, but I am still working on it to improve its functionality and fix any errors or bugs that may arise. I am open to contributions and suggestions from the community to continue improving the tool and provide an effective security solution for Linux systems.

# Update/upgrade

A system has been implemented to return to the main menu in case an action needs to be cancelled due to an error or change of mind, which helps prevent intentional errors and allows for a seamless return to the menu.

Additionally, a section has been added to the profile administration that displays the current status of each profile, making it easy to identify which profiles need to be configured or restricted.

We have developed a user manual to provide guidance on the proper use of the tool, including a brief glossary with essential terms. The aim is to facilitate understanding and handling of the tool by users."
